- 👋 Hi, I’m Vladimir
- 👀 I’m interested in React, Redux, MongoDB, Node js, Next Js, express ...
- 🌱 I have hands-on experience working with Cursor.ai as an AI-powered coding companion to accelerate development, and with Trae.ai for streamlining workflows through intelligent automation. I actively work with large language models (LLMs) to design and deploy conversational agents and AI-driven solutions. I’ve also built and integrated MCP servers to connect structured company data with AI applications, and use n8n to orchestrate complex workflows, automate processes, and link APIs and services seamlessly.
